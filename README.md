# Blindness-Detection
Blindness detection through image processing is a technique that uses computer vision and machine learning to identify signs of blindness in retinal images. This can be used to detect early signs of diseases like diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration, which can lead to blindness if left untreated.
