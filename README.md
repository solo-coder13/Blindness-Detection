# Blindness-Detection
Blindness detection through image processing is a technique that uses computer vision and machine learning to identify signs of blindness in retinal images. This can be used to detect early signs of diseases like diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration, which can lead to blindness if left untreated.
# APTOS-Blindness-Detection
Image Classification model for detecting and classifying **DIABETIC RETINOPATHY** using retina images.
Millions of people suffer from diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults. Eye Hospitals hopes to detect and prevent this disease among people living in rural areas where medical screening is difficult to conduct.

Build a deep learning model to speed up disease detection and classifying its category. Worked with thousands of images collected in rural areas to help identify diabetic retinopathy automatically.

These models may be used to detect other sorts of diseases in the future, like glaucoma and macular degeneration.

The Dataset was taken from Kaggle Competition ["APTOS BLINDNESS DETECTION"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data)

To further increase accuracy, increase epochs.
